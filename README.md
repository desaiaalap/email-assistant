<img src="extension/logo.png" alt="MailMate Logo" width="250"/>

## Overview

MailMate is an AI-powered email assistant designed to help professionals tackle email overload. The system combines advanced data pipeline processing with state-of-the-art LLM technology to provide three key services:

1. **Email Summarization** - Quickly understand the key points of long email threads
2. **Action Item Extraction** - Automatically identify tasks and deadlines from emails
3. **Draft Reply Generation** - Create contextually relevant, professional responses with a single click

MailMate offers contextual understanding through a Chrome extension that integrates directly with Gmail, helping users reduce the time spent managing their inbox.

## Project Components

This project consists of three main components:

### 1. Data Pipeline

Our data pipeline handles the ingestion, preprocessing, and quality control of email data. It uses Apache Airflow for orchestration and includes rigorous data validation with Great Expectations.

[See Data Pipeline Documentation](data_pipeline/README.md)

### 2. Model Pipeline

The model pipeline powers the AI behind MailMate, utilizing Google's Vertex AI Gemini models with custom prompt engineering and a sophisticated ranking system for high-quality outputs.

[See Model Pipeline Documentation](model_pipeline/README.md)

### 3. Chrome Extension

A user-friendly Chrome extension that integrates directly with Gmail, allowing users to leverage MailMate's AI capabilities with just a few clicks.
